# SuperviseAI Slide Deck (5 Slides)

## Slide 1 - Problem

Title: Thesis Supervision Is Broken at Scale

- Professors supervise many students with manual workflows.
- Feedback is delayed and hard to prioritize.
- Students arrive at defense underprepared.

Speaker line:
Universities need faster supervision loops and better defense preparation.

## Slide 2 - Solution

Title: SuperviseAI

- AI thesis supervision platform for students and professors.
- End-to-end workflow: upload -> analyze -> coach -> improve -> review.
- Role-based workspaces: student and professor.

Speaker line:
SuperviseAI turns fragmented supervision into one continuous, data-driven loop.

## Slide 3 - Product Demo Flow

Title: What Happens After One Upload

- ThesisTrack: progress score, structural gaps, abstract alignment.
- Citation validator: missing links, broken refs, formatting issues.
- Plagiarism pipeline: Copyleaks async + fallback heuristic.
- Realtime events update student/professor dashboards instantly.

Speaker line:
One submission generates actionable signals for both sides in near realtime.

## Slide 4 - AI Coaching Differentiator

Title: Adaptive Viva Coach

- Modes: Mock Viva, Argument Defender, Socratic Coach.
- Learner profiles: standard, ESL support, anxious speaker, advanced researcher.
- Live metrics: confidence, sentiment, argument quality, trend.
- End report: readiness score, weak topics, recommendations.

Speaker line:
This is not static Q and A - the coach adapts to the student while they answer.

## Slide 5 - Impact and Next Steps

Title: Why This Wins

- Faster professor feedback loops.
- Better student readiness and confidence before defense.
- Deployable architecture with optional AI integrations and graceful fallback.
- Immediate next step: pilot in one thesis cohort.

Speaker line:
SuperviseAI is hackathon-ready today and pilot-ready next.
