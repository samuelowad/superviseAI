# SuperviseAI Project Description

## Problem

Thesis supervision is fragmented and slow. Professors manage many students at once, feedback cycles are delayed, and students often reach defense day without enough structured practice.

## Solution

SuperviseAI is an AI-powered thesis supervision and viva coaching platform.

- Students upload thesis drafts (PDF/DOCX).
- The platform runs automated thesis analysis, citation checks, and plagiarism checks.
- Professors get a realtime dashboard with progress, risk signals, and review context.
- Students get an adaptive AI coaching experience (Argument Defender, Socratic Coach, Mock Viva) with readiness scoring and weak-topic feedback.

## Core Value

SuperviseAI compresses supervision feedback loops from weeks to minutes and gives every student structured, repeatable defense preparation.

## What Makes It Different

- One upload triggers a full analysis pipeline (thesis quality + citations + plagiarism).
- Adaptive coaching uses confidence and sentiment signals to adjust difficulty in-session.
- Student and professor views are connected through realtime updates.

## Target Track Fit

SuperviseAI directly serves the Education challenge by improving learning outcomes, supervision quality, and thesis defense readiness.
